# Lab introduction C

## Statement 1:

Write the program “Hellow world” included, compile and execute it to learnt how to use the Linux and C environments.

## Statement 2:

Modify the previous program to read a name from the keyboard and print the name on the screen. 

For example, if said name is John, your program will display “Hello John”

## Statement 3:

Then read the two integers separated on the entry line by a space .

## Statement 4:

Write a C program that displays the parameters that a C process receives on the screen.

## Statement 5:

Write a program that takes two real numbers as input and prints their sum to 3 decimal places. 
To add them, a  function “add” must be declared that adds both numbers and returns the result.

## Statement 6:

Write a program that takes an integer as an input argument, declares a 10-element vector, initializes it with the argument, and adds the 10 elements of the vector using first for and then while. 
The results of both sums will be printed on the screen.

## Statement 7:

Modify the above program so that the sum of the 10 elements of the vector is done in a function.
